# RUN
This is the official code for the game, "RUN".  This is a platformer game with art made by Kyle Nagasawa and everything else by Francis Fernandez. This game is in the making for Android and soon iOS. This is also being entered into the STEM Challenge competition.
All art was created by Piskel(www.piskelapp.com) and we used Unity 5(https://unity3d.com) as our game engine. We are all self taught and are in now way affiliated with any other program.
