# The-Real-Untitled-Game
This is the official code for the game, "The Real Untitled Game".  This is a platformer game with art made by Kyle Nagasawa and everything else by Francis Fernandez. This game is in the making for Android and soon iOS. This is also being entered into the STEM Challenge competition.
At a later date we will have a new name and a website set up. We will also have documentation to show how we made the game and what steps we took to make it.
All art was created by Piskel(www.piskelapp.com) and we used Unity 5(https://unity3d.com) as our game engine. We are all self taught and are in now way affiliated with any other program.
